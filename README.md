# CRW

## Installation

First, you need Go and Stack installed. Then you can build CRW. The CRW runtime
system is always statically linked with custom CRW programs. The following
commands will install a binary named `/tmp/CRWBuild/bin/CRW`:

```bash
$ (cd C && stack build)
$ Build/Build Core
```

There is not much you can do with this software right now, but hopefully this
will change in the near future.
